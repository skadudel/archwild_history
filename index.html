            <div class="text">It was once a lush environment where fishing and farming were the most common professions, but when [] took over and ruled with an iron fist she found four artifacts, three that were scattered through the region and were like keys that opened a gate in the ravine in the mountain that contained the last of the four artifacts. The fourth artifact was the very thing that gave the biome the lush environment that everyone was used to, and she cursed it to never again have the ability to keep the climate from being a frozen wasteland and instead only being able to bless people with mystical abilities that enhance either their ability to survive being attacked or their to ability to attack. </div>
            <div class="title2">The invasion</div>  
            <div class="text">After [] had taken power and turned the Frosty Enclave into the snowy area that it is today, she wanted more land and therefore went to war with all the other region. One by one the regions fell to []'s empowered warriors. When only the sandy region of Desma was left, a mighty warrior rose to power in the dessert who fought with [] and after a grueling battle [] fell and the warrior could slowly reestablish the seperate nations that are in a region each.</div>
